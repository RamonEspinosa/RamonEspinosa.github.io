          Back in 2022, I made the tough decision to leave Mexico and migrate to

          At this point in my career, I decided to master a specific role in web

          DaCodes brought me in as a contractor to team up with TTT Studios. 99%
          of the time, I was working with the folks at TTT, so when the project
          came to an end, they hired me directly to keep collaborating together.

          My colleagues were so much better than me, and I started experiencing

          Even so, I enjoyed working there. My boss and teammates were the best,

          During my university days, I landed an internship at a small startup
          near my home. Things were going great, and the boss liked my work so
          much that they offered me a full-time position.
