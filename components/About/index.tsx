      <h2>Get to know me better</h2>
      <p>
        TL;DR I am a <span>computer systems engineer</span> with over
        <span> 5 years of working experience</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was first introduced to a computer when my brother taught me how to
        play Age of Empires 2 in our first PC, a Compaq Presario S5100NX. To
        this day, we still love playing that and other RTS games.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since access to internet was extremely restricted and because there were
        no libraries near my house, I relied on Microsoft Encarta to do my
        homework. But at times I would get bored, which led me to discovering
        other software bundled in Windows XP like Minesweeper or 3D Pinball
        Space Cadet.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the age of 15, I took courses on support and maintenance of computer
        equipment. That paid itself as it got me some gigs and extra money,
        which I then used to assemble my own PC.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was so happy that I decided I should take this hobby of mine and
        profit the hell out of it. So 2 years later, I enrolled into university
        to study an engineering in Computer Systems. Of course it was not easy,
        but with the support of my family I ended up graduating with honors.
      </p>
      <p>
        I got my first professional job at a local company as a full-stack
        developer, and even though I was nailing it, it caused me so much stress
        due to the amount of work I got assigned and extremely tight deadlines.
        I lasted a full year there until I decided to move on in 2019.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is how I ended up in Prixz, where I met other developers like Hugo
        and Andres who straightened up my career and taught me a lot of what I
        know today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I got a call from DaCodes, they were looking to hire a developer
        that could in turn collaborate with TTT studios. At first, I was a bit
        hesitant about leaving my team, but since the offer was very attractive,
        I accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
        90% of the time I was helping TTT studios with their own projects, and
        they were so happy with my performance that in 2021 I got a job offer
        from them. This time, I did not hesitate as I was already spending more
        time with the folks at TTT.
      </p>
      <p>
        And that is how I migrated to Canada where I first met (physically)
        David, Chris and Gokul, whom I appreciate a lot by all the support they
        have showed me.
